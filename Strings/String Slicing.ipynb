Here are situations where slicing is particularly useful:**\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **1. Extracting Substrings**\n","   - When you need to extract a specific part of a string.\n","   - Example: Getting the first name from a full name.\n","     ```python\n","     full_name = \"John Doe\"\n","     first_name = full_name[:4]  # Output: \"John\"\n","     ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **2. Removing Prefixes or Suffixes**\n","   - To eliminate unwanted portions of a string.\n","   - Example: Removing the file extension from a filename.\n","     ```python\n","     filename = \"document.pdf\"\n","     base_name = filename[:-4]  # Output: \"document\"\n","     ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **3. Reversing a String**\n","   - When you need the reverse order of characters.\n","   - Example: Checking if a string is a palindrome.\n","     ```python\n","     text = \"madam\"\n","     is_palindrome = text == text[::-1]  # Output: True\n","     ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **4.
